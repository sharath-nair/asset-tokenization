/* A dedicated "Crowdsale" or "Token Sale" smart contract could be deployed.
Investors would send funds (e.g., ETH, USDC) directly to this smart contract.
The contract would handle fund collection, track contributions, and manage token distribution.

Investors can call a claimTokens() function on this contract after the sale period, or tokens might be automatically distributed.
